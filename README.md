# Project
Requirements for Labview: The app must provide a full set of basic Web app operations (CRUD - Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete): Add a computer (C) View a computer (R) Edit a computer (U) Delete a computer (D) The two attributes that each computer object has are hostname and status (up or down). A computer has ‘up’ status if it is connected to the network; it is ‘down’ if it is not connected. After all 17 lab computers in HH 310 have been added, change the default route of the Labview app to display all lab computers and their up/down status. The machines and status view must look something like the following. (This would be the result of the ‘view_all’ controller action.) (Green means ‘up’ status; red means ‘down’ status.) (+2 points extra credit) Use CSS to set the status colors.
